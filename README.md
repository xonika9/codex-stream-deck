# Codex Deck

[![CI workflow status](https://github.com/xonika9/codex-stream-deck/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/xonika9/codex-stream-deck/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Codex Deck brings the Codex Micro control model to an Elgato Stream Deck. It mirrors Codex's six native agent slots and sends Codex's own Micro events for actions, joystick directions, encoder clicks, reasoning effort, and official keycap commands. It does not type text or depend on global hotkeys.

This repository is a fork and continuation of [dazer1234/codex-stream-deck](https://github.com/dazer1234/codex-stream-deck). Current development and releases are maintained by [xonika9](https://github.com/xonika9).

> I share field notes on AI models and developer tools in [Controlled hallucinations](https://t.me/+DOZWlhI4r4EyYjgy), a Russian-language Telegram channel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an independent community project. It is not made, supported, or endorsed by OpenAI or Elgato. It uses undocumented Codex desktop internals and may need an update after a Codex release.

## Choose your setup

The same Stream Deck plugin package works in all three modes. Install only the launcher and configuration needed for your setup.

| Setup            | Stream Deck software | Codex controlled                 | Guide                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows only     | Windows              | Local Windows Codex              | [Windows setup](docs/WINDOWS.md)                                       |
| Mac only         | macOS                | Local Mac Codex                  | [macOS setup](docs/MACOS.md)                                           |
| Windows + Mac    | Windows              | Both apps; six agents are merged | [Multi-host setup](docs/MULTI_HOST.md)                                 |
| iPhone companion | iOS 17+              | Private Mac and/or Windows nodes | [iPhone app](docs/IOS.md) · [Install from source](docs/IOS_INSTALL.md) |

Desktop-only Windows and Mac modes need no relay, second computer, or host badges. Enabling the iPhone companion adds its authenticated pinned-TLS relay; multi-host desktop mode remains optional and can be disabled without changing the local bridge on either machine.

## Requirements

- Codex desktop on the computer being controlled.
- Elgato Stream Deck 6.6 or newer on the computer connected to the Stream Deck.
- Node.js 20 or newer for the platform launcher.
- Windows 10+ or macOS 13+.
- Tested hardware: standard 15-key Stream Deck MK.2.

Other Stream Deck models may work, but the included layout and physical-device testing target the normal 5×3 MK.2.

## Quick install

> [!NOTE]
> This fork does not have a published binary release yet. The instructions below describe the release installation path that will become available on the [releases page](https://github.com/xonika9/codex-stream-deck/releases); contributors can build the current source with the commands in [Build and release validation](#build-and-release-validation).

1. Download `com.xonika9.codex-deck.streamDeckPlugin` from the matching xonika9 release and open it on the computer running Stream Deck.
2. Download only the launcher for that computer:
   - Windows: `codex-deck-launcher-windows-vX.Y.Z.zip`
   - macOS: `codex-deck-launcher-macos-vX.Y.Z.zip`
3. Follow [Windows](docs/WINDOWS.md), [macOS](docs/MACOS.md), or [Windows + Mac](docs/MULTI_HOST.md).
4. In **Codex Settings > Codex Micro**, choose the agent source, action assignments, joystick actions, and encoder behavior.
5. Build the two Stream Deck pages below.

The iPhone companion is currently source-only: **a Mac with Xcode is required
to build, sign, and install it**, even when the phone will control only a
Windows Codex node. There is no App Store, TestFlight, or pre-signed IPA build
yet. After installation, the Mac does not need to stay online unless it is one
of the computers being controlled. Nearby pairing works on the same private
Wi-Fi without Tailscale; add Tailscale for private control away from home. See
the [beginner installation guide](docs/IOS_INSTALL.md) and the
[local Wi-Fi test](docs/IOS_LOCAL_WIFI.md).

In Windows + Mac mode, choose the same agent-source mode in both Codex apps when you want both native Pinned lists or both sets of Individual assignments to contribute. Pinned tasks are interleaved fairly. For Individual assignments, the Stream Deck computer wins when both apps assign different tasks to one button, while the other computer fills empty slots. Mirrored copies of the same task are shown only once. See [Multi-host behavior](docs/MULTI_HOST.md#agent-source-modes).

> [!WARNING]
> The xonika9 fork uses the new plugin UUID `com.xonika9.codex-deck`. Stream Deck treats it as a different plugin from upstream `com.simeo.codex-deck`: existing actions, per-action settings, and global plugin settings are not migrated automatically. Save or export your profiles, install only one variant at a time, rebuild both pages with the new actions, and then remove the old plugin. Local Codex Deck host, relay, and icon data remain in the existing platform data directory; the macOS watcher intentionally keeps its established `com.simeo.codex-deck.watcher` service label.

## Features

- Six dynamic agent keys using the source and assignments selected in **Codex Settings > Codex Micro**.
- Optional global **Active queue** for all six Agent actions on one computer; it is off by default.
- Live idle, working, unread completion, approval/input, error, and empty states.
- Codex-aligned light and dark rendering with restrained status animation.
- Native key-down/key-up handling for Micro slots `ACT06` through `ACT12`.
- Native joystick up, right, down, left, and encoder click.
- Dedicated reasoning-effort up/down buttons with press-and-hold repeat.
- Live usage controls: a configurable circular 5-hour/weekly limit key and a two-window overview.
- A centered reset-credit counter with a deliberate 1.2-second hold before an applicable credit can be consumed.
- A local `codex://threads/new` action for a new task.
- Standalone actions for all official single-size keycaps, resolved from the installed Codex build at runtime.
- Optional local loading of official keycap SVGs; those protected files are never included in this repository or its releases.
- Optional authenticated SSH/Tailscale relay for one Stream Deck controlling Windows and Mac Codex together.
- Per-host health on the Windows/Mac target key, with last-known agent tiles visibly marked when native desktop signals are uncertain or the relay is offline.
- Native SwiftUI iPhone companion with dual-host agents, usage, reset credits, and authenticated Micro controls over pinned-TLS Nearby Wi-Fi or private Tailscale HTTPS.

### Active queue

Enable **Active queue** in any Agent action's property inspector to compact relevant tasks into the first Agent keys. The setting applies globally to Agent 1–6 on that computer and defaults to off. It draws from Codex's native pinned and unpinned sidebar catalog: attention and error tasks come first, completion/unread tasks follow in FIFO order when activity times are available, and working tasks follow from newest to oldest. Idle and off tasks are hidden, the remaining positions close up without gaps, and the displayed queue remains capped at six.

If the renderer's full catalog is temporarily unavailable or incompatible, Active queue fails closed to the existing six native Micro slots without taking the normal snapshot offline. A healthy black position is unassigned and does nothing when pressed. Connecting, degraded, and offline diagnostics remain visible.

On a profile with N Agent buttons, place logical **Agent 1** through **Agent N** next to each other in order. Idle chats cannot be opened from those buttons while the queue is enabled. Pinned and unpinned tasks participate in the full native catalog; **custom** deliberately keeps only its six configured candidates, and the queue may still compact the relevant ones. Disable Active queue to restore the exact existing single-host or multi-host agent-source layout.

## Recommended 15-key layout

This is the actual polished two-page layout used for the MK.2. It keeps the six live agents on the main page and puts lower-frequency navigation/reasoning controls on page 2.

> This layout is only a recommendation and a practical starting point. Every action, position, page, and profile can be customized freely to match your own workflow; Codex Deck does not require this exact arrangement.

### Page 1 — agents and daily actions

| Agent 1                 | Agent 2           | Agent 3                | Agent 4                 | Agent 5         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Agent 6                 | Action 1 / Fast   | Action 2 / Approve     | Action 3 / Reject       | Action 4 / Fork |
| Action 5 / Push-to-talk | Keycap · Browser¹ | Stream Deck: Next Page | Reasoning Encoder Click | New Task        |

The action names describe the default Codex Micro setup. The keys always follow the live `ACT06`, `ACT07`, `ACT08`, `ACT09`, and `ACT10/11` assignments selected in Codex. ¹If you use `ACT12` / Send more often than Browser, put **Action 6 / Send** in that position instead.

### Page 2 — navigation and reasoning

| Windows / Mac Target + Health² | Empty                | Joystick Up / Plan         | Reasoning Down           | Reasoning Up            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Empty                          | Joystick Left / Back | Stream Deck: Previous Page | Joystick Right / Forward | Reasoning Encoder Click |
| Stream Deck: Switch Profile³   | Empty                | Joystick Down / Sidebar    | Empty                    | New Task                |

²Use the target key only in Windows + Mac mode. In a single-computer setup, leave it empty or replace it with another keycap action. ³Configure Stream Deck's built-in **Switch Profile** action to return to your own standard profile; no user-specific profile ID is distributed.

The page-navigation and profile-switch keys are built-in Stream Deck actions. All other named controls come from Codex Deck. Every official Codex Micro keycap is also exposed as a standalone action, so extra pages can be customized without changing the six synchronized Micro action slots.

### Usage and reset controls

![Usage limit, overview, and reset-credit controls](docs/assets/usage-controls-preview.svg)

Add **Usage Limit** for the existing circular capacity display. Its Stream Deck property inspector can pin the key to **5 hours** or **Weekly**, while **Automatic** prefers 5 hours and falls back to weekly whenever Codex temporarily omits the shorter window. **Usage Overview** shows both windows as separate horizontal bars; a missing window stays visible as unavailable instead of being mistaken for zero capacity.

**Rate Limit Reset** shows the number of credits Codex currently reports. The count remains centered inside the reset arrow and the action is dimmed only when no credit is available. Consuming a credit requires holding the key for 1.2 seconds; a short tap does nothing, and Codex's current applicability check still has to pass. This action uses Codex's current native usage client and is therefore subject to the same undocumented compatibility boundary as the Micro bridge.

Usage and reset credits are account-scoped. In Windows + Mac mode these three keys therefore do not follow the Windows/Mac function-key target: they prefer the healthy local account snapshot and fall back to the paired host only when local usage data is unavailable.

## Official keycap SVGs are not included

The public source and release intentionally exclude OpenAI's Codex Micro keycap SVG files. The original agent tiles, status marks, glow system, animations, fallback labels, and plugin artwork are included.

If you have the right to use the files already present in your own Codex installation, copy them outside the repository to:

```text
Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexDeck\icons
macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/CodexDeck/icons
```

Name each copy after its Codex keycap ID, such as `FAST.svg`, `APPR.svg`, `REJ.svg`, `SPLIT.svg`, or `MIC.svg`. Codex can inspect your local installation and copy the exact existing SVG files for you when explicitly instructed not to redraw, download, upload, publish, or commit them. See [Local icon setup](docs/ICON_SETUP.md) for the guarded workflow and complete filename list.

## How it works

```text
Stream Deck key
    -> Codex Deck plugin
    -> loopback-only Chrome DevTools connection
    -> Codex renderer host-event bus
    -> native Codex Micro handler
```

The launcher enables a random Chrome DevTools port bound to `127.0.0.1`. The plugin discovers version-hashed renderer modules, reads the native Micro layout/state, and dispatches the same event families used by the Micro integration:

- `codex-micro-device-state-changed`
- `codex-micro-hid-event`
- `codex-micro-joystick-event`

No virtual HID driver is installed and no Codex application file is patched. See [Architecture and security](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Security and privacy

- The Codex debug endpoint remains loopback-only and is never the multi-host relay endpoint.
- CDP is privileged: another untrusted process running as the same local user could try to access it.
- Codex Deck has no telemetry, cloud service, or update service.
- Codex Deck reads exact local rollout filenames for ownership and a bounded recent tail for structural status tags plus numeric `token_count` fields. It does not parse or relay prompts, responses, project names, or other conversation content.
- Optional SVGs stay in the user-local icons directory and are never uploaded.
- Multi-host mode accepts only authenticated, typed Codex Deck commands over SSH or Tailscale; wildcard and arbitrary public-IP listeners are rejected.
- Private relay tokens, local host state, logs, and personal paths are excluded by the release audit.

Do not use the launcher while running untrusted local software. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Compatibility

Compatibility is versioned with each release because Codex Deck depends on undocumented Codex desktop internals. After the first xonika9 release, consult the notes and validation evidence on the [releases page](https://github.com/xonika9/codex-stream-deck/releases) for the tested combinations.

The last upstream validation covered the Windows physical-device path and the Windows + Mac relay on a real setup. It also covered the macOS launcher, watcher, native bridge, and plugin package, but not a Stream Deck physically attached to the Mac. Treat those results as historical validation evidence, not as strict minimums, maximums, or a guarantee for later Codex builds.

## Troubleshooting

Start with [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). The important rule is: restart only the Stream Deck plugin/app for plugin updates. The macOS watcher never launches a closed Codex app; after a manual app start it permits at most one guarded recovery restart and opens a global cooldown before any later recovery.

## Build and release validation

```powershell
npm ci
npm run check
npm test
npm run validate
npm run pack
npm run audit:release
```

`npm run release:prepare` creates a versioned local release-candidate directory with the plugin package, Windows launcher ZIP, and SHA-256 checksums. The macOS ZIP must be created on macOS with `scripts/package-macos-release.sh` so executable bits survive; pass that ZIP to `scripts/prepare-release.ps1 -MacArchivePath ...`.

For a four-component Stream Deck hotfix version, set
`CODEX_DECK_RELEASE_VERSION=X.Y.Z.W` while running the macOS packager and pass
`-ReleaseVersion X.Y.Z.W` to `prepare-release.ps1`. The npm package keeps its
SemVer-compatible prerelease form.
